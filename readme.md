This is the successor of [hyn/multi-tenant](https://github.com/hyn/multi-tenant). It is still
in development. Feel free to start this project, follow progress via [twitter](https://twitter.com/laraveltenancy) and
back its development using [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/tenancy).

# Roadmap 2018

- Finish the tenancy/tenancy package with all necessary contracts and bare logic.
- Create tenant identification drivers that replicate the logic of the predecessor (eg hostname based identification).
- Create mysql (including mariadb) and postgres database drivers.
- Enforce a code coverage of at least 90%.
